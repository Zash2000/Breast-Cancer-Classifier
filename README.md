# ðŸ§  Breast Cancer Classifier
A machine learning project to classify breast cancer as benign or malignant using medical data. This project aims to assist in early diagnosis by leveraging classification algorithms and data visualization.

## ðŸ“Š Overview 
A machine learning project in **R** using **Logistic Regression** to classify breast cancer tumors as **benign** or **malignant**. This project demonstrates how R can be used for medical data analysis and classification modelling.

## ðŸ§¬ Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression)

Hyperparameter tuning

Performance metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC

## ðŸ“Œ Dataset
This project uses a modified version of the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, () originally available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used
- R programming language
- `tidyverse`
- `caret`
- `pROC`
- `ggplot2`
- `readr` and many more!
- Jupyter Notebook
